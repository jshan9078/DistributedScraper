Count Cards by PSA Grade

This script scans a Google Cloud Storage bucket and counts the total number of
complete certificate cards for each PSA grade. A complete card must have both
front and back images.

Prerequisites:
- Google Cloud Storage credentials JSON file
- google-cloud-storage Python package

Setup:
1. Install required package:
   pip install google-cloud-storage

2. Set your Google Cloud credentials:
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/credentials.json"

Usage:
   python count_cards_by_grade.py

The script will:
- Scan all PNG files in the bucket under the png/ prefix
- Identify complete certificates (both front and back exist)
- Count unique certificates per PSA grade
- Display a summary table of results
